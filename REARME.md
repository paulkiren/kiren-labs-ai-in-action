# AI in Action: Start with Ollama + Local Model Fine-tuning

## Why This Approach is Ideal for Learning

- **Runs entirely on your M4 chip**  
    Leverage excellent GPU acceleration for efficient training and inference.

- **Comprehensive Workflow**  
    Covers data preprocessing, model training, inference, and deployment.

- **Real-World Applicable Skills**  
    Gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques used in production environments.

- **Full Control Over the Pipeline**  
    Understand and manage every step, from raw data to deployed model.

Get started by setting up [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and exploring local model fine-tuning on your machine!


Learning Path (2-3 weeks):
Week 1: Foundation

Set up Ollama and experiment with different models
Build a simple chat interface using the Ollama API
Learn about tokenization, embeddings, and vector databases

Week 2: RAG System

Implement document ingestion and chunking
Create embeddings with sentence-transformers
Build retrieval system with ChromaDB
Connect everything for document Q&A

Week 3: Optimization & Deployment

Experiment with different chunking strategies
Try model quantization techniques
Build a simple web interface with Streamlit/Gradio
Monitor performance and memory usage

This approach gives you experience with:

Model inference and APIs
Vector databases and similarity search
Data preprocessing pipelines
Performance optimization
Local deployment strategies

The M4 chip handles 7B-13B parameter models very well, so you'll get real performance without needing cloud resources.

## Project Overview
You'll build a personal document Q&A system that demonstrates the complete AI pipeline:
- Document processing and chunking
- Embedding generation and vector storage
- RetrI've created a comprehensive starter project that will teach you AI architecture through hands-on experience! This project builds a complete document Q&A system that demonstrates the entire AI pipeline.
What you'll learn:

Document processing and chunking strategies
Vector embeddings and similarity search
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Local LLM inference and optimization
Full-stack AI application development

Key features of this project:

Runs entirely local on your M4 MacBook Pro
Complete pipeline from document upload to AI responses
Real-time chat interface with source citations
Optimized for M4 chip with appropriate model sizes

To get started:

Follow the setup commands in the guide
Start with some sample documents (PDFs, Word docs, or text files)
Upload them through the web interface
Start asking questions!

The project is structured to grow with your learning. Week 1 focuses on getting everything working, Week 2 adds advanced features, and Week 3 optimizes performance.
Your M4 chip will handle the 7B parameter models very efficiently, giving you professional-grade performance without needing cloud resources.
